# UniversityPortfolios
Hi Reader,
The purpose of these documents is to showcase some definitive examples of what I have been exposed to throughout university.
The folders may not have everything completed during the project as I am missing some files or they were not relevant/I had no input on those sections.
I hope you enjoy viewing them and thank you for reading through them.
Regards,
Gianni Pessotto
