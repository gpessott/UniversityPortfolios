# UniversityPortfolios- Please read. 
Hi Reader,

The purpose of these documents is to showcase some definitive examples of what I have been exposed/completed/contributed to throughout university.
The folders are based on subjects I completed at UTS (except the report folder which is a collection of reporting/research I completed).
The folders may not have everything completed during the project as I am either; missing some files, the remaining files were not relevant or I had no input on those sections.

To navigate, click on a folder than select a document. Once viewing a document (word documents require a download to view), you must use the back arrows or reslect the folder to return to the previous screen.
Else, if you need to go back one folder while not viewing a document page, you can select the 2 dots to return to the previous menu. 
(Unfortunately, screenshots do not work inside the README so they will be available for reference in the main folder)

I hope you enjoy viewing them and thank you for reading through them.

Regards,
Gianni Pessotto
